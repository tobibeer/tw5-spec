=================

A repo providing (drafts of) specifications for [TiddlyWiki5](http://tiddlywiki.com) core features or plugins of interest by [tobibeer](https://github.com/tobibeer) based on the basic tenet that a spec is a living reference document, i.e. the culmination of evolutionary iterations of a feature, rather than a one-time description for every individual implementation step.

This repo is an attempt to cast the overall design of a core feature or plugin into a coherent concept based on a simple narrative based on the following conceptual building blocks:

[Epic](Epics.md)

» a bucket for all the possible implementations that make a feature great, for all the conceptually distinct building blocks that, together, make up the feature like [Sections](./Sections)

[User Story](UserStory.md)

» encodes a desirable implemenatation in terms of who wants what and why and eventually how
