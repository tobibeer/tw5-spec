The following pattern encodes a desirable implemenatation:

## User Story

**As** `<role | persona | stakeholder>`

**I want** `<what>`

**so that** `<why>`

## Acceptance Criteria

* `R0100` a list of functional and non-functional requirements
    * `R0100a` each with unique identifiers
* `R0200` that precisely define what a system should do, e.g.
* `R0200a` the system should do ...
* `R0300` but not how things are to be implemented
    * `R0300a` leave that to the solution

## Problem Description

Some background, pain points, motives behind a given implementation. An iteration as to why it is wanted and then why that is wanted and then why that is wanted and so forth.

## Suggested Solution

A precise, more technical draft of the implementation design and strategy, again with...

* `S0100` a list of uniquely identifiable
* `S0200` implementation steps and details
